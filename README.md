# codingprojects
This repository contains some of my coding projects completed in Python and C for lab assignments at Swarthmore College. Here is an overview of three lab assignments I have completed for review and grading. 


CS31: Intro to Computer Systems, Spring 2020

Lab 2: Sorting Data

Link to Lab 2 for more details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab02/
Overview: We implemented a program called Lab_2_sorter.c that sorts floating point numbers using a sorting algorithm of your choice in C. The program read a
collection of unsorted floats from a file, stored those floats in an array, provided some information about the floats to the user, sorted them from smallest
magnitude to largest magnitude (i.e., ascending order), and printed them out in sorted form to the user.

Lab 4: Statistics

Link to Lab for more details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab04/

Overview: We created a program called Lab_4_stats.c a C program that computes some statistics on a set of values that it 
reads in from a file. The program will use C pointers and dynamic memory allocation to allocate enough space for the set of 
values it reads in. In addition, we wrote a sum function in IA32 assembly that is compiled into a program that 
we used to test our function.

CS35: Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2020 

Lab 6: Game Of Life

Link to Lab 6 details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab06/

Overview: We created a program called Lab_6_gol.c that plays Conway’s Game of Life. 
Conway’s Game of Life is an example of discrete event simulation, where a world of entities live, die, or are born based based on their surrounding neighbors. 
Each time step simulates another round of living or dying. We implemented 2D arrays, pointers, dynamic memory 
allocation and practiced passing pointers to functions.

CS71: Software Engineering, Fall 2021

SWE Project Name: Rainr 
Overview: Rainr is a web app that allows for a user to predict chances of floods in Delaware County. A user can input their address, or select a location on the map, and Rainr will generate a GIF of simulated water accumulation in the surrounding area.
Collaborator(s): Alfisyanrin Muhamad, Kaidan Fullerton, Max Sundgren

CS43: Networks, Spring 2022

Lab 2: A Concurrent Web Server

Link to Lab 2 details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/cs43/s22/labs/lab2.html

Overview: This lab focused on building a web server. We found the requested files and serving them back to the clients. Some other tasks that were completed inlclude implementing the server side of (non-persistent) HTTP over a TCP connection, applying socket system calls (bind, listen, and accept) on a server process to interact clients and using threading to serve multiple concurrent clients.

CS63: Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2022

Lab 5: Neural Networks 

Link to Lab 5 details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs63/f22/labs/05.html

Overview: Implementing a neural network from scratch using Python.
