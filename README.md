# codingprojects
This repository contains my some of my coding projects completed in C for lab assignments at Swarthmore College. Here is an overview of three lab assignments I have
completed for review and grading. 


Lab 2: Statistics

Link to Lab 2 for more details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab02/
Overview: We implemented a program called Lab_2_stats.c that sorts floating point numbers using a sorting algorithm of your choice in C. The program read a
collection of unsorted floats from a file, stored those floats in an array, provided some information about the floats to the user, sorted them from smallest
magnitude to largest magnitude (i.e., ascending order), and printed them out in sorted form to the user.

Lab 4: Sorting Data

Link to Lab for more details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab04/

Overview: We created a program called Lab_4_sorter.c a C program that computes some statistics on a set of values that it 
reads in from a file. The program will use C pointers and dynamic memory allocation to allocate enough space for the set of 
values it reads in. In addition, we wrote a sum function in IA32 assembly that is compiled into a program that 
we used to test our function.

Lab 6: Game Of Life

Link to Lab 6 details: https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~chaganti/cs31/s20/labs/lab06/

Overview: We created a program called Lab_6_gol.c that plays Conway’s Game of Life. 
Conway’s Game of Life is an example of discrete event simulation, where a world of entities live, die, or are born based based on their surrounding neighbors. 
Each time step simulates another round of living or dying. We implemented 2D arrays, pointers, dynamic memory 
allocation and practiced passing pointers to functions.
